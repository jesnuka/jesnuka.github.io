## Personal Projects

### Character Mods for the game Don't Starve Together
I have made Two LUA based character mods for the game Don’t Starve Together,
published to Steam Workshop. 
The characters were made using LUA, modifying already found files in the game files, writing new code and drawing new graphics.

### Aalto Games Now - Game Jam 2019 Game - BioTrio
I attended Aalto University's 2019 Games Now course Game Jam, which lasted 3 days.

[Here is the link to the game's submission page.](https://itch.io/jam/gnjam19/rate/421844)  
and [here is the link to the game's itch.io page](https://rinisra.itch.io/bio-trio)
The game was built in Unity and programmed with C#.

My responsibilities included the 2D art and animations for the characters and programming some parts of the game, like the weapon mechanics and some enemy mechanics, as well as various smaller fixes and additions.

Here is a screenshot from the game:

### Eko Game Jam 2019 - SHAMES
I attended [Eko Game Jam 2019](https://www.ekogamejam.org/) which lasted 3 days.

[Here is the link to the game's submission page,](https://itch.io/jam/eko-game-jam/rate/438259)
and [here is the link to the game's itch.io page](https://jarimiranda.itch.io/shames)

The game was built in Unity, programmed with C# and was made for mobile android devices.

The game uses a database for the emissions that are calculated from: https://ilmastodieetti.ymparisto.fi/ilmastodieetti/swagger/ui/index#/

My responsibilities included programming the emission calculations and how they are fetched as JSON for Unity, creating the card change mechanics and their interactions with the player status and also some Unity's editor side things.
I also worked on some of the UI.

Here are screenshots from the game:

## School Projects

### Text Adventure Game

[Extreme Pilkki](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=634d491974f44686c5e420f01f615606)

Small game developed for a task in Aalto University course, using Puzzlescript game engine. 

### Responsive Website Project
This [website](https://jesnuka.github.io/Responsive-website/) was done as a project for Responsive Web Design course at VIA University College, Aarhus, Denmark together with Julia Korhonen. It includes responsive design and works in multiple resolutions, including mobile.

### Tower Defense Game - Gatekeepers
Gatekeepers is a tower defense game I made for an Aalto University course using Scala programming language and [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) for the graphical rendering. The graphics in the game were made by me, inspired by the graphics supported by the Nintendo Entertainment Systems (NES), with a 4 color palette on each sprite in the game. The colors are also chosen from those that the NES supports. This was my first attempt at using Processing with Scala, which provided some challenges, as it did not support some functionalities that well. However, the game works in it's current state, but is slowed down quite much depending on the computer it is run on.

The enemies are programmed to recognize the road in the game, allowing the map to the fully customized in the text files, which means that more levels can be made. However, the maps do not currently support forks in the road, or roads that are wider than one tile.

The game features 10 levels currently, but supports adding more. It has an interactive menu and a level selector screen. The levels can be edited in a text file and are loaded from there when the game starts.
The main game has build and destroying mode. If the player has enough currency, they can build turrets by placing them on tiles, with the exception of the roads, walls and the exit and entrance. In the destroying mode, the player can click these turrets to break them and get 2/3 of their money back. These turrets automatically shoot at nearby enemies, giving the player gold by defeating the enemies. Once the player is ready and clicks the swords icon on the right side, the round will start and the enemies will spawn. They move along the road and will try to reach the exit, unless killed. If the player's health reaches zero, they will lose. By winning each round, they will win the level.

### Online Game Store
[This website](http://gamestore-torque.herokuapp.com/store/index) is an online game store made for Aalto University Web Software Development course. It was done in a group of three. In this project my responsibilities were:

- Login Authorization and User Registration using Django Auth (Created User app for all auth features)
- "Forgotten Password" - feature, Email account confirmation, Email change confirmation email (Using Console Backend)
- Profile (Password change, Profile Edit, Avatar change/add)
- Final Site Styling (Logo, Color scheme, Fonts) 
- Images on site (Default profile picture, Front page banner and Forestrunner ad, Torque logo, default game picture) 
- 3rd Party Login (Facebook) using Django allauth 
- Custom error pages
- Front-end (CSS, Bootstrap) for (Login/Registration, Profile, Registration, Nav-bar ) 
- Own Javascript game, “Forestrunner”, [which is playable here](http://gamestore-torque.herokuapp.com/store/coolgame)

### Demo MR Application for the CloudXR team
This project was done during a software project course in Aalto University. It was done for the CloudXR Research Team to demonstrate the benefits of cloud rendering. The game was built in Unity, programmed with C# and built for Android phones. The project is an AR game that features a maze that the player must travel through, while avoiding traps and trying to reach checkpoints and eventually the goal. The maze is rendered onto a large enough area that the player points to using the phone's camera. This is done using Google's ARCore. The settings in the game allow for a locally rendered version to be toggled to a cloud rendered version, which shows the increase in FPS during gameplay.

My contribution to the project involved both programming and graphics. I modeled the traps, checkpoints, torches and the goal using Blender, and textured them accordingly. I also worked with the effects that the traps and torches produce. Programming wise I worked with the characters movement, created the checkpoints system that returns the player to the last interacted checkpoint after their death. I also created the goal system in the game, which ends the current game and allows for a new maze to be created.

### Training Ducks to Collect Bread - Machine Learning Agents in Unity
[DuckPool](https://jesnuka.github.io/DuckPool/) is a machine learning project made together with Julia Korhonen for "Artificial Intelligence and Applied Methods" course in Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden.

The project was built in Unity, programmed with C#.

The goal of the project was to train a virtual duck to be the most efficient at finding bread in a contained environment with limited time. It was done using Unity and an Unity plugin called “The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents)”. This plugin enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. The agents can be trained using different machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API. The 3D Models were made using Blender.

The view has two different ducks, the other with no training and another one that has had training with speed multiplied by 100 for the duration of 3 hours.
